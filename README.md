# DataStructures
A collection of data structures for educational purposes. Contains skeleton code for anyone to use as practice and to learn. Contains unit tests and "solution" implementations.

I recommend forking this repo and filling in the missing code to get all tests passing.

This is a work in progress. I'll be adding more data structures when I can!

ArrayList
---------
`IntArrayList.java` defines an ArrayList that only allows ints (for simplicity).
Fill in the missing code in `IntArrayList.java`.

Compile and run tests with:

`% javac *.java`

`% java IntArrayListTests`
