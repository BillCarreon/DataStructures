# DataStructures
A collection of data structures for educational purposes. Contains skeleton code for anyone to use as practice and to learn. Contains unit tests and "solution" implementations.

This is a work in progress. I'll be adding more data structures when I can!

How to
------
This repo is comprised of several projects, each focused on implementing a common data structure. Each project is a directory that contains

1. skeleton code for the data structure. The public methods are declared, but most of their implementation is missing.
2. unit tests. Most of these should fail (not crash) in the beginning. The goal is to implement the missing code in the data structure file so that it passes all these tests.
3. a Makefile. Enter the command `make` to compile the project, and `make run` to compile and run the unit tests.

I recommend forking this repo and filling in the missing code to get all tests passing.

ArrayList
---------
`IntArrayList.java` defines an ArrayList that only allows ints (for simplicity).
Fill in the missing code in `IntArrayList.java`.

`GenericArrayList.java` defines an ArrayList that allows any Object. The methods
to implement are a subset of those in IntArrayList
